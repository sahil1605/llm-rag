# Usage Scenarios to Try

1) Developer onboarding
- Upload the docs in this folder. Ask: "Create a setup checklist for this demo on macOS." 

2) API support
- Ask: "Explain how to upload, load, and ask, with example curl commands." 

3) Troubleshooting
- Ask: "Why could /upload return 405? Provide the likely cause and fix." 

4) Summarization
- Ask: "Summarize the difference between retrieval-only vs RAG+LLM in <=80 words." 

5) Structured extraction
- Ask: "Return JSON with keys endpoints, inputs, outputs filled from the docs only."
